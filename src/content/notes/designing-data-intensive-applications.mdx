My notes on the quintessential distributed systems book
[Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) 
by Dr. Martin Kleppmann.

### Reliable, Scalable and Maintainable Applications

TBC.

### Data Models and Query Languages

Most software applications are built by layering one data model over another. For
each layer, the key question is: how is it _represented_ in terms of the next layer?
For example:

1. Application developers model the real world into data structures, 
and APIs (algorithms) that manipulate those data structures.
2. When you want to store these data structures, you convert them into general-purpose
data models such as JSON, XML, SQL tables, graph models etc.
3. The database developers decided on a way to convert these data models in terms of
bytes in memory, on disk, or on a network. They also decided on a way to do operations 
(like CRUD) on this data.
4. At the lowest level, hardware engineers represent those bytes in terms of 
electrical currents, magnetic fields, light pulses etc.

#### Relational Model vs document model

Definition of SQL: data is organized into relations (called tables in SQL), 
where each relation is an unordered collection of tuples (rows in SQL).

Originally used for business data processing in the 60s and 70s:
- Transaction processing: sales transactions, airline reservations.
- Batch processing: customer invoicing, payroll, reporting.

The goal of the relational model was to abstract away the internal representation
of the data behind a cleaner interface.

NoSQL started in the 2010s to overcome some limitations of the relational model:
- Scalability, including very large datasets or very high write throughput
- FOSS over commercial software
- Specialised query operations not supported by SQL
- Desire for a more dynamic and expressive schema or data model

Modern applications have an _impedance mismatch_ between the object-oriented 
application code and the relational data in databases. ORMs can help reduce the
differences but not completely eliminate them.

For data structures like self-contained documents (e.g. resumes), a JSON 
representation is more suitable than a relational model due to better locality.
