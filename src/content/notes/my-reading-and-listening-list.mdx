A collection of books, newsletters and podcasts on software engineering that I use to improve as an engineer, and keep up to date with the latest developments in the industry.

## Books

I use books to deep dive into topics I want to fully explore. I find them as a useful tool for mastering fundamentals such as software architecture, algorithms and software development practices.

If I want to learn a new language/library/framework, I prefer to read the documentation instead, and then build small projects utilising that language/library/framework to gain a better understanding.
