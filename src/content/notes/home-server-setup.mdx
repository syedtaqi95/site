This page contains the instructions to set up a [home server](https://surfshark.com/blog/home-server). It will host a number of services that I use regularly, like hosting my personal files, a remote development environment, web apps, and anything else I want to run on a piece of silicon.

## Requirements

- Server should be relatively cheap to run. No GPU clusters running ChatGPT, I have bills to pay.
- Private services: personal file hosting, remote development environment, productivity tools like my notes, task management etc. Maybe even a mail server if things go well
- Public services: mainly my public experiments in software like this website
- Private services should be secure and accessible only to me, such as through a VPN
- All services should be accessible via HTTPS from outside my home network
- Server should use dynamic DNS instead of static IP. The less I interact with my ISP, the better
- Compatible with observability and monitoring tools like Grafana and Prometheus.

## Hardware
