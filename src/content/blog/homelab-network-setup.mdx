I'm writing this article as I'm about to move my homelab to another Linux distro
and will need to come back here for help when I inevitably break prod.

## Overview

These are the steps required to setup a homelab on Linux:

1. Backup, backup, backup.
2. Install and configure a web server. I use [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com)
   running inside a docker container.
3. Start your web services. I use a single `docker-compose.yml` file to 
   provision my services (web apps, Nextcloud and some observability tools).
4. Set up port forwarding and set your homelab to a static IP address 
   in your IP router's control panel.
5. Open up the required ports on your firewall using `ufw`.
6. Set up a local DNS server for local access. `dnsmasq` is a good shout,
   remember to disable systemd-resolved.
7. Configure and enable dynamic DNS for your domain name. I use ddclient to
   connect to Namecheap's excellent dynamic DNS API.
